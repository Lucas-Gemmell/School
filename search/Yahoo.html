            <div class="text-box">
                <p>
                    Similar to Google, I am talking about their search engine and none of their other products, like
                    their email service. Yahoo was originally called “Jerry and David’s Guide to the World Wide Web.”
                    They then changed it to “Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle,” which is where Yahoo!’s name
                    comes from. I will reference Yahoo! as Yahoo so we don’t get confused about the exclamation mark.
                </p>

                <h3 data-color="green">Strengths</h3>
                <h4><u>News Content</u></h4>
                <p>
                    If you like to see the news and what’s going on, Yahoo displays some news when you open a blank tab.
                    I won’t read the news because I can’t change it. But that’s a personal opinion and this should be
                    professional.
                </p>
                <h4><u>Many Mobile Apps</u></h4>
                <p>
                    The apps are for mobile devices. I assume they are for their other products. So it might not be
                    relevant for their search engine. However, it does allow Yahoo users to use Yahoo more than their
                    competitors.
                </p>

                <!------------------------------------->

                <h3 data-color="red">Weaknesses</h3>
                <h4><u>Sells Your Data</u></h4>
                <p>
                    From my searches, Yahoo is better at not selling your data than Google. It is still free so the end
                    user is still the product. They do train their AIs on you to show you ads that you're more likely to
                    click on, hence making them money.
                </p>
                <h4><u>Poor Ad Labeling</u></h4>
                <p>
                    I did find in my searches quite a bit that when using Yahoo, it’s hard to tell between organic and
                    ad content. This means that it’s more likely you will click the ads that are paying large amounts of
                    money for that keyword that doesn’t even relate to their business.
                </p>

                <h3>Conclusion for Yahoo!</h3>
                <p>
                    My rating of Yahoo is 4/10. The ratings of Yahoo I could find on the web didn’t say much about what
                    they did well. Of course, this was only for the search engine. I do know that they have a very large
                    amount of products that I use a few of.
