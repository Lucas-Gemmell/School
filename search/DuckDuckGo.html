                <p>
                    DuckDuckGo is a search engine that is focused on privacy. It doesn’t save your search history to show
                    you more relevant searches. The DuckDuckGo website states, “Over 96% of popular free Android apps we
                    tested allow other companies to invade your privacy, like using your location to map everywhere you go.”

                <h3 data-color="green">Strengths</h3>
                <h4><u>Doesn’t Save Your Data</u></h4>
                <p>
                    This is great for people who are paranoid about who knows where they are at all times. For example, if
                    you search for ‘cars for sale,’ Google might get your location and then save it to use later for you.
                    While DuckDuckGo would just ask for your location this one time then delete that data. This way no one
                    could hack DuckDuckGo and then see where everyone lives.
                </p>
                <h4><u>Doesn’t Sell Your Information</u></h4>
                <p>
                    Another great thing DDG (DuckDuckGo) gives you is peace of mind. This is because you know that people at
                    Google, Facebook and other tech giants don’t have access to your data.
                </p>
                <h4><u>Loads Websites Faster</u></h4>
                <p>
                    Websites would load faster because they aren’t running multiple processes to steal your data. When
                    various processes aren’t taking all of your data, your computer can simply load the webpage to the
                    browser window.
                </p>

                <h3 data-color="red">Weaknesses</h3>
                <h4><u>Searches Aren’t Personalized</u></h4>
                <p>
                    DDG doesn’t save your search history to train their AIs to display your desired content. Hence, you only
                    get what you searched for as a result.
                </p>
                <h4><u>You will Still See Ads</u></h4>
                <p>
                    While DDG does not sell your data, they still need to make money. So they show you ads based on your
                    search only and not your past 200 searches.
                </p>
    
                <h3>Conclusion for DuckDuckGo</h3>
                <p>
                    My rating for DDG is 9/10. The reason is that they don’t sell my data. Another thing I like about them
                    is that they don’t display ads for my past searches. They simply show ads for my search.
