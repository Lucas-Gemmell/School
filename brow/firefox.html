                        Mozilla Firefox
                    </a>
                    or just Firefox, is a free open-source web browser. Open source means that anyone
                    can contribute to its development. Firefox was the very first web browser to offer a bookmarks page.
                    If you don’t know what a bookmark is, you can think of it as saving a string for the URL to the
                    website so you can find it faster later.

                <h3 data-color="green">Strengths</h3>
                <h4><u>Speed</u></h4>
                <p>
                    Firefox is known for its speed and reliability. This allows you to search quickly for information
                    and receive it quickly.
                </p>
                <h4><u>Privacy</u></h4>
                <p>
                    Another thing that Firefox is great at is not selling user data to third parties like Google.
                    Meaning that you won’t be getting spam emails from random companies you don’t even know exist.
                </p>

                <!------------------------------------->

                <h3 data-color="red">Weaknesses</h3>
                <h4><u>Ram Usage</u></h4>
                <p>
                    Firefox uses a ton of RAM. This will slow down your other processes running in the background.
                    For example, you won’t be able to run an Android emulator as fast. For a more general example,
                    we can say that if you run out of RAM your computer will have to decide to put the small amounts
                    of RAM it gets from processes ending into what needs it. This means you have to wait for some RAM
                    to clear before using it again.
                </p>
                <h4><u>Fewer Plugins</u></h4>
                <p>
                    While only a few people are vivid plugin users, this is sad for them. Firefox has most of the
                    well-known plugins that Chrome has. It has over 36,000 plugins while Chrome has 130,445 plugins.
                </p>
                <h4><u>Doesn't Use Google Efficiently</u></h4>
                <p>
                    In this school district, it wouldn’t make anyone worried. If we used Google’s services more, then
                    Firefox would go off the table. This is because Firefox does not integrate with Google well. For
                    example, if you type doc. new into the search bar, it will create a new Google doc for you.
                </p>

                <h3>Conclusion For Firefox</h3>
                <p>
                    I am going to give Firefox a 7/10. This is because I use Google quite a lot. For example, I am writing the text for this assignment in Google Docs.
