                    Microsoft Edge, previously Internet Explorer, is the default web browser for Windows 10 and 11. It has
                    an AI-powered search engine and chatbot built into the browser.
                </p>

                <h3 data-color="green">Strengths</h3>
                <h4><u>Efficiently uses Microsoft Products</u></h4>
                <p>
                    Microsoft Edge is owned by Microsoft, so it enables users to use Microsoft products efficiently.
                </p>
                <h4><u>AI Browsing</u></h4>
                <p>
                    Due to how big Microsoft is, their engineers can build great things. For example, Edge uses AI to
                    display results at the top of the search. Beneath it is the search results for your search. It also has
                    a chatbot at the top of the browser where you can ask it questions.
                </p>
                <h4><u>PDF Reading and Editing</u></h4>
                <p>
                    This is useful whenever I complete a unit in this course. I just load up Edge, close all of the popups,
                    then open my PDF then start adding my work to it. It also probably uses OCR (optical character
                    recognition) to read the PDF to you. OCR is just when an AI detects text and makes it a string or
                    something. This would let it use another AI to create the sound bytes to play to you.
                </p>

                <h3 data-color="red">Weaknesses</h3>
                <h4><u>So Many Popups</u></h4>
                <p>
                    From my experience, whenever I open up Edge, I get about 5 popups every time. It is very annoying when I
                    turn in my learning guide.
                </p>
                <h4><u>Old Devices Can’t use it</u></h4>
                <p>
                    Downloading Edge on a Windows machine takes 1 gigabyte of memory for a 32-byte Windows computer. It
                    takes 2 gigs for a 64-byte Windows computer. The computer must also have 1GHz of processing memory or
                    more. This excludes older computers from using it.
                </p>
    
                <h3>Conclusion For Microsoft Edge</h3>
                <p>
                    For Microsoft Edge, I will rate it at a 5/10. The reasons are that they don’t use Google products
                    efficiently. Another reason is that it has so many popups. I hate pop-ups.
