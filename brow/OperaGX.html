                    Opera GX is a variation of the Opera web browser. It was made specifically for gamers to maximize
                    performance while gaming. Some cool features it has, that we will dive into below, include limiting
                    CPU and RAM. Here are the strengths of Opera GX.

                <h3 data-color="green">Strengths</h3>
                <h4><u>Limit CPU</u></h4>
                <p>
                    The purpose of limiting CPU usage allows users to search faster. This also lets other programs run
                    in the background faster. For example, my virus detector, Norton, has to be able to run tasks while
                    I’m doing different things, like coding.
                </p>
                <h4><u>Limit RAM</u></h4>
                <p>
                    This has the same reasons as to why we can limit CPU usage. It’s so we can use more memory in other
                    programs. Using the example with Norton, it would have to be able to store the program in memory to
                    test if it’s malicious software.
                </p>
                <h4><u>Workspaces</u></h4>
                <p>
                    Workspaces are my favourite part of Opera GX. They allow you to have multiple tab groups open. For
                    example, I have one for coding research, school, and a random one.
                </p>
                <h4><u>Free AdBlocker</u></h4>
                <p>
                    The ad blocker built into Opera GX is my second favourite feature. I don’t have to see any ads,
                    while watching YouTube, searching for information or any other time.
                </p>

                <!------------------------------------->

                <h3 data-color="red">Weaknesses</h3>
                <h4><u>Limited Plugins</u></h4>
                <p>
                    All of the web browsers that aren’t Chrome are going to have this issue. If you want to use a
                    particular plugin, make one or use Chrome. However, I do find that I can add Chrome plugins to my
                    Opera GX browser so that is also an alternative.
                </p>
                <h4><u>Website Compatibility</u></h4>
                <p>
                    Sometimes when loading full-screen content, it fails to load properly. If this does happen I just
                    use Chrome for that website.
                </p>

                <h3>Conclusion For Opera GX</h3>
                <p>
                    I will give Opera GX an 8/10. There is a bias of course because I use it. The main reason is because
                    of the workspaces and the ad blocker. I am not worried about the amount of extensions as I don’t
                    use them.
